# Quick installation list
-- Install new gazebo 1.8.7+ (via mercurial checkout, see gazebosim.org)
  -- need urdf parser support (check cmake output when building)
-- run ./generate_sdf_from_urdf.sh (creates urdf, sdf files from xacro)
-- Create a symlink at /home/$USER/.gazebo/models/darci which points to gt_meka_description/sdf/
-- Install plugins (hrl_gazebo_plugin_world, hrl_gazebo_plugin_model, hrl_gazebo_plugin_tactile)
  -- Installed location may not work with gazebo >= 1.9
. Install pr2_controller_configuration_gazebo
  --which includes libpr2_controller_manager (for joint_trajectory_controller)
  -- This does not reflect the controller API on real meka robots
. Run ./start_darci.sh (loads urdf to robot_description param, starts gazebo w/darci, then starts controllers, and sets torso position)


# Notable differences from meka_description URDF -- List may be inaccurate or incomplete, but is all I can remember changing
. Many mass/inertia values have been changed to match the dynamatics files and Jeff Bingham's corrected Inertia Matrices
. The 'zlift_link' has been removed and replaced with 'torso_lift_link' (same visual/collision/inertia elements)
    - The 'torso_lift_link' is centered between the shoulder joints
. The 'upper' link has been removed and replaced with 'chest_link' (same visual/collision/inertia elements)
    - The 'upper' link has a fixed joint with identity transformation from 'torso_lift_link' (only difference is in the models attached to each)
. 'forearmor' and 'flipper' links have been added to the left arm to represent our tactile sening cover.
. 'handmount_FT_LEFT' link, with cylindrical visual/collision/inertia has been added to the left hand to represent the ATI mini40 F/T sensor on the hand.  The model should be accurate to the mounting and specs from ATI for that sensor, but may or may not be on your robot
. No meshes or URDF contend has been included for hands, head, or 2-part torso (not present on Darci)
    - These meshes and original URDF contents should be available in meka_description, and can be incorporated
. The world->base joints have been changed to fixed (but original p-p-r joint parameters are still present, if you switch back)

. All URDF materials were removed as these are incompatible with Gazebo materials
. Inertia elements were added for some links, as this is required for conversion to sdf
. Many sdf-only parameters are set in 'gazebo' tags, located in the urdf/gazebo folder.  These are ignored in URDF, and incorporated in SDF during conversion
